# Backend Engineering Roadmap

## 1. Introduction

Backend engineering encompasses building **reliable**, **scalable**, **fault-tolerant**, and **maintainable** codebases and systems.

Learning backend development can be challenging due to the **vast scope of topics** and the importance of seeing the **big picture**.

Starting with a narrow scope, like a specific language or framework, can lead to **blind spots** and make it hard to transfer knowledge across ecosystems.

A **high-level understanding** of how backend systems work, including **request/response flows**, is essential to becoming a well-rounded backend engineer.

---

## 2. HTTP Protocol

Understanding the **HTTP protocol** is foundational. This includes how communication is established and the structure of raw HTTP messages.

Key components include:
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Status codes (200, 404, 500, etc.)
- Headers and their roles

---

## 3. Routing

Routing connects **URLs** to **server-side logic**, often based on HTTP methods.

It’s important to understand different route types:
- Static routes
- Dynamic routes
- Nested routes

---

## 4. Serialization & Deserialization

Serialization translates complex data to transferable formats like **JSON** or **XML**, while deserialization does the reverse.

Understanding their **performance implications** and format tradeoffs is essential for system interoperability.

---

## 5. Authentication & Authorization

These are critical for system security.

Key topics include:
- Stateful vs. stateless authentication
- Token-based authentication (JWT)
- Authorization strategies (role-based, attribute-based)

---

## 6. Validation & Transformation

Validation ensures incoming data is **syntactically and semantically correct**.

Types include:
- Type checks
- Required fields
- Complex conditional validation

Transformations may involve:
- Converting strings to numbers
- Normalizing emails (e.g., lowercase)
- Data formatting

**Sanitization** protects against attacks like SQL injection and XSS.

---

## 7. Middlewares

Middlewares are components that process requests and responses.

Common uses:
- Authentication
- Security headers
- Logging
- Error handling

Middleware **order matters**, and they are often **chained** to handle responsibilities step by step.

---

## 8. Request Context

The request context stores **temporary, scoped metadata** passed through controllers, services, and middlewares.

Includes:
- Request metadata
- User/session info
- Logging/tracking data

Best practices:
- Keep it lightweight
- Clean up after use
- Avoid tight coupling

---

## 9. Handlers, Controllers & Services

These are core building blocks for request handling.

- **Handlers/controllers** manage HTTP-specific logic.
- **Services** encapsulate reusable business logic.

Best practices:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Centralized error handling
- Consistent success/error responses

---

## 10. CRUD Deep Dive

CRUD operations map closely to HTTP methods:
- Create → POST
- Read → GET
- Update → PUT/PATCH
- Delete → DELETE

Best practices:
- Strict validation
- Consistent response formatting
- Limit payload size

---

## 11. RESTful Architecture

REST designs APIs around **resources** and follows HTTP semantics.

Important considerations:
- Filtering, sorting, pagination
- API versioning
- OpenAPI documentation
- Content negotiation
- Client-side caching

---

## 12. Databases

Databases may be **relational** (SQL) or **non-relational** (NoSQL).

Key topics:
- Schema design and normalization
- Indexing and query optimization
- Transactions and concurrency
- CAP theorem and consistency models

---

## 13. Business Logic Layer (BLL)

The BLL contains the **core application logic**, interfacing between routes and the data layer.

Includes:
- Domain models
- Business rules
- Validation logic

Follows principles like:
- Separation of concerns
- Single responsibility
- Dependency inversion

---

## 14. Caching

Caching improves performance and reduces database load.

Types:
- In-memory (e.g., Redis)
- Browser-level
- CDN or database caching

Strategies:
- Cache-aside
- Read-through
- Write-through

Eviction policies:
- LRU (Least Recently Used)
- LFU (Least Frequently Used)
- TTL (Time To Live)

---

## 15. Transactional Emails

Transactional emails are triggered by user actions or system events.

Structure:
- Subject, preheader
- Body and CTA
- Footer and headers

Use cases:
- Notifications
- Confirmations
- Password resets

---

## 16. Task Queuing & Scheduling

Task queues handle:
- Email sending
- Image processing
- Long-running jobs

Schedulers manage:
- Database backups
- Recurring tasks
- Time-based automation

---

## 17. Elasticsearch

Used for:
- Search suggestions (type-ahead)
- Log analytics
- Full-text search

Core concepts:
- Inverted index
- Term frequency
- Inverse document frequency

---

## 18. Error Handling

Involves managing:
- Syntax errors
- Runtime exceptions
- Logical errors

Strategies:
- Fail-safe vs. fail-fast
- Error logging and alerting
- Standardized error messages

---

## 19. Configuration Management

Handles environment-specific settings outside of code.

Sources:
- Environment variables
- Config files (YAML, JSON, etc.)
- Command-line flags

Promotes **12-factor app** compliance.

---

## 20. Logging, Monitoring & Observability

These tools provide **insight into system behavior**.

- **Logging**: record events
- **Monitoring**: track metrics, uptime
- **Observability**: combine logs, metrics, and traces for full visibility

---

## 21. Graceful Shutdown

Ensures services shut down **cleanly and safely**.

Process:
- Capture termination signals
- Stop accepting new requests
- Complete in-flight tasks
- Release resources

---

## 22. Security

Protect systems from:
- SQL injection
- XSS (Cross-site scripting)
- CSRF (Cross-site request forgery)

Principles:
- Least privilege
- Defense in depth
- Secure defaults

---

## 23. Scaling & Performance

Focus areas:
- Response time and latency
- Resource usage
- Bottleneck identification

Techniques:
- Caching
- Batching
- Indexing
- Reducing network overhead

---

## 24. Concurrency & Parallelism

- **Concurrency**: multiple tasks at once (IO-bound)
- **Parallelism**: tasks simultaneously (CPU-bound)

Both improve performance depending on the use case.

---
