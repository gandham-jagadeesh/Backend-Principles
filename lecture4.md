# Backend Engineering from First Principles

- Learning backend engineering from first principles helps in breaking down complex systems into basic components, allowing for easier identification of core logic, routing layers, and database connections, and making changes or fixing bugs with confidence.

- Understanding the first principles behind backend engineering enables faster onboarding into new languages or frameworks, as the focus is on core concepts rather than syntax, allowing for a deeper sense of familiarity with a codebase.

- Having backend knowledge grounded in first principles helps in starting new projects from scratch with incredible speed and precision, creating MVPs with production-quality code, and structuring routes, setting up database connections, and implementing critical functionalities.

- Learning from first principles reduces syntax fatigue, as switching between languages is no longer daunting, and it becomes easier to apply the right syntax and libraries to solve actual problems, making it easier to transition into a new language, such as from Node.js to Rust.
